## <a id="a"></a> CÂU TRỰC TIẾP, CÂU GIÁN TIẾP (REPORTED SPEECH) TRONG TIẾNG ANH

### <a id="a1"></a> I. KHÁI NIỆM
Câu tường thuật là câu thuật lại lời nói trực tiếp.

**Lời nói trực tiếp (direct speech):** là nói chính xác điều ai đó diễn đạt (còn gọi là trích dẫn). <br> Lời của người nói sẽ được đặt trong dấu ngoặc kép.

Ví dụ: She said ,” The exam is difficult”. "The exam is difficult" là lời nói trực tiếp hay câu trực ti

**Lời nói gián tiếp – câu tường thuật (indirect speech):** Là thuật lại lời nói của một người <br> khác dưới dạng gián tiếp, không dùng dấu ngoặc kép.
Ví dụ: Hoa said,”I want to go home” -> Hoa said she wanted to go home là câu gián tiếp (indirect speech)

### <a id="a2"></a> II. CÁCH CHUYỂN CÂU TRỰC TIẾP SANG CÂU GIÁN TIẾP
Khi chuyển từ một lời nói trực tiếp sang gián tiếp khá đơn giản, chúng ta chỉ cần ghép nội dung <br> tường thuật ở phía sau câu nói và hạ động từ của nó xuống một cấp quá khứ, đại từ được <br> chuyển đổi cho phù hợp. Tuy nhiên, cần lưu ý một số vấn đề sau:

  - Nếu động từ tường thuật (reporting verb) chia ở các thì hiện tại chúng ta giữ nguyên thì <br>(tense) của động từ chính, đại từ chỉ định và các trạng từ chỉ nơi chốn cũng như trạng từ chỉ <br>thời gian trong câu trực tiếp khi chuyển sang gián tiếp.
  <br>**Ex :**
    - He says: “I’m going to Ha Noi next week.”
    - ⇒ He says he is going to Ha Noi next week.

  - Nếu động từ tường thuật (reporting verb) của câu ở thì quá khứ thì phải lùi động từ chính về <br> quá khứ một bậc khi chuyển từ lời nói trực tiếp (direct speech) sang lời nói gián tiếp <br>(indirect / reported speech) theo quy tắc sau:
  
    **Biến đổi thì của động từ và động từ khuyết thiếu theo bảng sau:**
    |    Câu trực tiếp                |    Câu gián tiếp            |
    | ---------------------------     | --------------------------- |
    |    Present simple               |    Past simple
    |    Present continuous           |    Past continuous
    |    Present perfect              |    Past perfect
    |    Past simple                  |    Past perfect
    |    Present perfect continuous   |    Past perfect continuous
    |    Past continuous              |    Past perfect continuous
	  |    will                         |    would
    |    can                          |    could
    |    must/ have to                |    had to
    |    may                          |    might
